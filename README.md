GUIDE:
(Cool way to start the guide i know)
Disable your antivirus as some tweaks might not work 
Dont follow blindly think for yourself
And dont blame me if something doesn't work as expected
REMEMBER TO TAKE A RESTORE POINT FOR BACKUP!

Firstly download these:
[BleachBit - Storage cleaner](https://www.bleachbit.org/download/windows)
[NZTSAPP - Some really cool tweaks](https://github.com/nezhatweaks/nztsapp/releases)
[Hellzerg Optimizer](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases)
!Rebar! - Use Amd if you have a amd gpu OR Use nvidia one but read their descriptions carefully might !BRICK your pc
[AMD or any other](https://github.com/xCuri0/ReBarUEFI/releases)
[Nvidia Turring GTX 1600 / RTX 2000 GPUs](https://github.com/terminatorul/NvStrapsReBar)

1.Open Bleach bit and tick everything except passwords and cookies for browsers!
Click on clean 
Magic happens

2.Use chris titus utility from powershell and do whatever you think is cool
[ChrisTitusUtil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil)
Use the powershell command in the main page not in releases.

3.Similarly for hellzerg optimizer enable optimizations you want
[Hellzerg](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases)

4.Finally my favourite section that makes this guide different from other guides
Use NZTSApp i will guide you on this because its kind of confusing
[NZTS](https://github.com/nezhatweaks/nztsapp/releases)

- 1. Disable your antivirus this usually gets flagged as a malware
